## Shift-Invariant Artificial Neura Network

A kind of neura network.

Shift-Invariant means it is resistant to the displacements of the input images. It can handle changes in the images, and still perform well on classification tasks.

## Element-wise

Do the calculation element by element. like A.*B .
So if a function is element-wise and you give an input with size n*m, it will apply to each element and return an output with the same size.
